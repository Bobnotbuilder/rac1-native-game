// Blarg's Nebula G34 (level 6) on its own overlay. Level 6's engine build is
// close to Rilgar's (1849 of Veldin's 1974 functions found in its overlay, 84.2 %): the hero controller is Blarg's own build of the
// source (22 functions that are neither Veldin's nor any other level's, transliterated at level 6's addresses, `// orig: L6:0x00xxxxxx`,
// blarg_hero_tr_*.cpp), 12 functions are the same code as Veldin's / another level's that the matcher could not place, and the rest
// of the engine is Veldin's. The generic parts (the table rows, on_level) are in variants.h.
